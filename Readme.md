[![purescript-httpurple on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-httpurple/badge)](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-httpurple)

A functional http framework with a focus on type-safety and making the common case easy. 

This project was originally forked from the amazing [HTTPure](https://github.com/citizennet/purescript-httpure) http server framework, but has since deviated quite a bit. If you are coming from HTTPure you might want to have a look at the [differences to HTTPure](./docs/Differences.md).
